## Step 1: Problem Definition

### Business Context
MTN Rwanda is the leading telecommunications provider in Rwanda, serving over 6 million customers across all four provinces (Kigali City, Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western). As part of Rwanda's Vision 2050 digital transformation agenda, MTN Rwanda's analytics team wants to understand customer usage patterns and revenue trends across urban and rural areas to improve customer retention and support the country's cashless economy goals through mobile money (MoMo) and data services.

### Data Challenge
MTN Rwanda needs to identify their highest-value customers (top 10% by monthly spend) across different provinces, analyze month-over-month revenue growth patterns for voice, data, and mobile money transactions. The company wants to segment customers based on urban vs. rural usage patterns and track running revenue totals by province while calculating 3-month moving averages to support government partnerships and rural connectivity initiatives.

### Expected Outcome
These insights will enable MTN Rwanda to implement targeted retention campaigns for high-value customers, optimize network coverage for underserved rural areas, design province-specific mobile money promotions, and support Rwanda's digital inclusion goals. The analysis will guide strategic decisions on infrastructure investment priorities and new digital service launches aligned with Rwanda's smart city and rural development objectives.

## Step 2: Success Criteria

### 5 Measurable Business Goals

1. **Top 5 Highest-Revenue Customers per Province per Quarter** → `RANK()`
   - Identify VIP customers generating highest monthly revenue (voice + data + MoMo) in each province for targeted retention programs

2. **Running Total of Daily Mobile Money Transaction Volume** → `SUM() OVER()`
   - Track cumulative MoMo transaction values to monitor Rwanda's cashless economy progress and identify peak usage periods

3. **Month-over-Month Customer Churn Rate Analysis** → `LAG()/LEAD()`
   - Calculate percentage change in active customer base compared to previous month to predict and prevent customer loss

4. **Customer Lifetime Value Quartiles for Marketing Segmentation** → `NTILE(4)`
   - Divide customers into 4 tiers based on total revenue contribution over 12 months for personalized marketing campaigns

5. **6-Month Moving Average of Network Data Traffic per Base Station** → `AVG() OVER()`
   - Smooth network congestion data to identify infrastructure investment priorities and predict capacity needs
